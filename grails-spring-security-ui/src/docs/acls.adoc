== ACL Management

ACL management should be done using the API exposed by `AclService` and `AclUtilService`. Both services have a much more intuitive and convenient high-level approach to managing ACLs, ACEs, etc. The functionality in this plugin is to provide a CRUD interface for fine-grained ACL management.

The ACL menu is only available if the http://grails.org/plugin/spring-security-acl[ACL plugin] is installed.
