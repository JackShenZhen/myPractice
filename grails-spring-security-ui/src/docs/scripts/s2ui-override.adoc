[[s2ui-override]]
=== s2ui-override

.Purpose

Generates controllers that extend the plugin's controllers and copies their GSPs to your application for overriding of functionality.

The general format is:

....
grails s2ui-override <type> [controllerPackage]
....

The script will copy an empty controller that extends the corresponding plugin controller into your application so you can override individual actions and methods as needed. It also copies the controller's GSPs. The exceptions are when type is 'auth' or 'layout' which only copy GSPs.

See the <<customization>> section for more details.
