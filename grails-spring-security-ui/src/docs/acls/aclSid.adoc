=== AclSid Management

The default action for the AclSid controller is search. By default only the standard fields are available but this is customizable with the <<s2ui-override>> script - see the <<customization>> section for details.

The `sid` field has an Ajax autocomplete to assist in finding instances. Leave the field empty and `principal` set to Either to return all instances.

Results are shown paginated in groups of 10. The column headers are clickable and will sort the results by that field:

==== AclSid Edit

After clicking through to a sid you get to the edit page (there are no view pages):

You can update the name and whether it's a Principal sid or a Role sid, and delete the instance if there aren't any associated `AclObjectIdentity` or `AclEntry` instances - by default there is no support for cascading.

You can also see the associated `AclObjectIdentity` instances (OIDs) or `AclEntry` instances.

==== AclSid Create

You can create new instances by going to `/aclSid/create` or by clicking the `Create` action in the `SID` menu under `ACL`.
