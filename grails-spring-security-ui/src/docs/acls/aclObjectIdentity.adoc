=== AclObjectIdentity Management

The default action for the AclObjectIdentity controller is search. By default only the standard fields are available but this is customizable with the <<s2ui-override>> script - see the <<customization>> section for details.

Leave all fields at their default values to return all instances.

Results are shown paginated in groups of 10 and you can click on any header to sort by that field:

==== AclObjectIdentity Edit

After clicking through to an AclObjectIdentity you get to the edit page (there are no view pages):

You can update any of the attributes, and can delete the instance if there aren't any associated `AclEntry` instances - by default there is no support for cascading.

You can also see the associated `AclEntry` instances.

==== AclObjectIdentity Create

You can create new instances by going to `/aclObjectIdentity/create` or by clicking the `Create` action in the `OID` menu under `ACL`.
