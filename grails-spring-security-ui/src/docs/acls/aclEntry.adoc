=== AclEntry Management

The default action for the AclEntry controller is search. By default only the standard fields are available but this is customizable with the <<s2ui-override>> script - see the <<customization>> section for details.

Leave all fields at their default values to return all instances.

Results are shown paginated in groups of 10 and you can click on any header to sort by that field:

You can update any of the attributes or delete the AclEntry.

==== AclEntry Create

You can create new instances by going to `/aclEntry/create` or by clicking the `Create` action in the `Entry` menu under `ACL`.
