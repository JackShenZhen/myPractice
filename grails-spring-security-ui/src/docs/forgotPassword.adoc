== Forgot Password

Like the Registration workflow, the Forgot Password workflow is expected to be user-facing. So it's not available in the admin menu like the User, Role, and other backend functionality - you'll need to expose them to your users.

One way to do this is to replace the default `login.gsp` that's provided by the Spring Security Core plugin with this plugin's version. You can do this by running `grails s2ui-override auth` - see the section on <<customization>> for more details. If you do this your users will have links to both workflows from the login screen:

=== Forgot Password

Navigate to `/register/forgotPassword`:

After entering a valid username an email will be sent and you'll see a success screen:

image::forgot_password_sent.png[]

Click on the link in the email:

image::forgot_password_email.png[]

and you'll open the reset password form:

After entering a valid password you'll finalize the process, which involves storing the new password hashed in the user table and pre-authenticating, then redirecting to the configured destination:

=== Configuration

The post-reset destination url is configurable in `grails-app/conf/application.groovy` using the `postResetUrl` attribute:

[source,java]
----
grails.plugin.springsecurity.ui.forgotPassword.postResetUrl = '/reset'
----

If you don't specify a value then the `defaultTargetUrl` value will be used, which is `'/'` by default.

You can customize the subject, body, and from address of the reset email by overriding the default values in `grails-app/conf/application.groovy`, for example:

[source,java]
----
grails.plugin.springsecurity.ui.forgotPassword.emailBody = '...'
grails.plugin.springsecurity.ui.forgotPassword.emailFrom = '...'
grails.plugin.springsecurity.ui.forgotPassword.emailSubject = '...'
----

The `emailBody` property should be a GString and will have the User domain class instance in scope in the `user` variable, and the generated url to click to reset the password in the `url` variable.

=== Mail configuration

By default the plugin uses the http://grails.org/plugin/mail[Mail] plugin to send emails, but only if it installed. This is configurable by registering your own `MailStrategy` implementation - see [the section on configuration|guide:customization] for more information. The plugin assumes that the Mail plugin and an SMTP server are already configured.

=== Notes

Like the registration code, consider this workflow as starter code. Run `grails s2ui-override register` to copy the registration controller and GSPs into your application to be customized.

[NOTE]
====
`RegisterController` and its GSPs assume that your User domain class has an `email` field.
